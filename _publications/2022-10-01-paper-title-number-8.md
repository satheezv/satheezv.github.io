SwarmItFIX (self-reconfigurable intelligent swarm fixtures) is a multi-agent setup mainly used as a robotic fixture for large Sheet metal machining operations. A Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) based planning model is utilized currently for computing the locomotion sequence of multiple agents of the SwarmItFIX. But the SwarmItFIX faces several challenges with the current planner as it fails on several occasions. Moreover, the current planner computes only the goal positions of the base agent, not the path. To overcome these issues, a novel hierarchical planner is proposed, which employs Monte Carlo and SARSA TD based model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for the computation of locomotion sequences of head and base agents, respectively. These methods hold two distinct features when compared with the existing methods (i) the transition model is not required for obtaining the locomotion sequence of the computational agent, and (ii) the state-space of the computational agent become scalable. The obtained results show that the proposed planner is capable of delivering optimal makespan for effective fixturing during the sheet metal milling process.
