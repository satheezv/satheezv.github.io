This work investigates on the coordinated locomotion between a ceiling-mounted serial manipulator and two SwarmItFIX robots. The former holds the machining tool as an end effector, and the other two robots act as swarm robotic fixtures in a sheet metal milling process. A novel offline coordination planner which follows the hierarchical based hybrid type decentralized planning strategy has been proposed. Motion of the serial manipulator and SwarmItFIX robotsâ€™ coordinated locomotion are divided into three sub-problems, viz, trajectory planning of serial manipulator, task planning of SwarmItFIX robots, and homogenous prioritized multi-robot path planning of SwarmItFIX robots. Mathematical formulation of all the three sub-problems is developed and presented in this paper. A hexagonal segment that fits inside the boundaries of the workspace is considered as the machining trajectory. The tool velocity is assumed to be constant as it improves the quality of machining. The results obtained from the proposed planner is found to be efficient as the task planning module has computed the precise support locations and support duration for the SwarmItFIX robots. The multi-robot path planning module of the planner computes the optimal collision-free paths of SwarmItFIX robots for all goal positions. Finally, trajectories of SwarmItFIX robots are found to be completely in-line with the trajectory of tool center point (TCP) of the serial manipulator.
