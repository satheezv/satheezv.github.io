  <strong>Robotic Chemist Demonstration @ British Science Festival, Liverpool</strong><br>
  On 14 September 2025, I showcased our research on Robotic Chemists and Self-Driving Labs at the British Science Festival (Museum of Liverpool).
  It was a pleasure engaging with the public and sharing the work from the Autonomous Chemistry Lab (Cooper Group, University of Liverpool).
  <br><br>
  I was joined by Abdoulatif, and Michael and Megan demonstrated the robotic chemist. Special thanks to George and Vikki for organising the demonstration.
  <br><br>
  Grateful to Prof. Andrew Cooper FRS, Prof. Matt Rosseinsky OBE FRS, and the EPSRC Programme Grant for the opportunity and support.
