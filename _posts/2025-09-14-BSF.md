  <strong>Robotic Chemist Demonstration @ British Science Festival, Liverpool</strong><br/>
  On 14 Sept. 2025, I had the opportunity to showcase and explain our research on Robotic Chemists and Self-Driving Labs at the British Science Festival at the Museum of Liverpool.

It was a pleasure engaging with the public and sharing the exciting work happening in the Autonomous Chemistry Lab, Cooper Group, University of Liverpool.

I was joined by colleagues Abdoulatif, and Michael and Megan, who demonstrated their robotic chemist project, with special thanks George and Vikki for organising the demonstration.

Grateful to Prof. Andrew Cooper FRS, Prof. Matt Rosseinsky OBE FRS, and the EPSRC Program Grant for providing this opportunity and supporting us in making it possible.
