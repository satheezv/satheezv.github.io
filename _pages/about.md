Hi, 

I am Satheeshkumar, currently holding the position of Research Associate - Robotics in the Cooper Group at the Materials Innovation Factory, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom. My primary focus is to enhance safety of mobile manipulator robots to execute complex navigation and manipulation tasks in safety-critical robotic workflows. We have explored using techniques like Embodied-AI based perception (CNNs, VLMs, LLMs) through multi-modal information (HandEye, Olfactory, Tactile, Force-Torque, LIDAR, CCTVs), perception-action coupling, Decision trees, and Digital Twin (Sim2Real) to enhance situational awareness ability of these Mobile Robots. I am proud to mention that two of our above works were presented at Flagship Robotics Conference ICRA 2025 at Atlanta, four papers are under review at prestigious Science, Nature Computational Intelligence, Nature communications and RAL journals. The above projects are done in collaboration with reputed Universities (University of Toronto and University of Rostock) and Industries (GSK, PFIZER, and AstraZeneca).

Previously, I held a Postdoctoral Researcher position at the Human-Robot Interaction lab within the Centre for AI, Robotics, and Human-Machine Systems (IROHMS) at Cardiff University, United Kingdom. My research here focused on autonomous navigation and manipulation of a Humanoid robot in dynamic environments to perform tasks like grasping and Human-Robot collaborative object transfer. To capture real-time data from the state space, we utilized the sensing modalities like Vicon motion tracking system, haptics, RealSense cameras, in conjunction with AI allowing us to record dynamic state information. 

I did my PhD in Robotics and AI at Indian Institute of Information Technology and was awarded the competitive HTRA Fellowship for my doctoral research by the Ministry of Education, Govt. of India. My research focused on the coordination of multiple robots with constrained locomotion to assist manufacturing, primarily aerospace industry. Specifically, we used various Reinforcement Learning methods to address challenges related to coordinating multiple robots, multiple agents of a robot. This project was done in collaboration with University of Genova, Italy. I'm proud to share that all my impactful research findings have been disseminated through top-tier journals and conferences.

My proficiency extends beyond research into the practical realm of robotics, where I excel at leveraging tools such as ROS, ROS2, Nvidia IsaacSim, and CoppeliaSim; AI (CNNs, LLMs, VLMs, RLs); as well as programming languages like Python, MATLAB, and Java. These skills enable me to effectively address complex challenges in robotics, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

In addition to my research endeavours, I bring a wealth of academic teaching and management experience, spanning 7 years. During this period, I had the privilege of instructing various courses related to robotics and AI. I was also involved in lab establishment and management activities including preparation of lab layout, risk assessments, robot procurement. 
My career aspiration is to become an expert in the field of Robotics & AI. 

<!-- I firmly believe that securing this Lectureship position at a reputed institution like University of York would significantly enhance my technical and professional capabilities, ultimately involve in state-of-the-art robotics research. I am genuinely enthusiastic about this opportunity and would be immensely grateful for the chance to engage in a discussion regarding how my experience and proficiency in robotics research can complement the requirements of this position. My curriculum vitae, which includes a comprehensive list of my publications, is attached with the application for your kind consideration.  -->

Thanks, and regards,
